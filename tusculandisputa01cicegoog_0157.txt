“A sepulchre, or any place in which a person was buried,
was religiosusr all things which were letl or belonged ιο the
Dii Manes were religio& those consecrated ιο the Dii
Superi were called sanae Eren the place in whicha
slave was buried was considered as religious. Whoerer vio-
lated a sepulchre was subject to an acuon termed sepulcri
eidus· aetio. Those who removed the bodies or bones from
the sepulchre were punished by death or deportatio in insu·
lant, according to their rank, if the sepulchre was violated in
any other way, they were puuishcd by deportatio, or condem·
nation to the mines'' ldid. p. 562.

Cf. Laetius, iv. 13 (nemu, p. 97). See, also, Creuser, on
Cic. de legg. I. xxii. 55, p. 3213 and the authorities cited
by Moser, iu his note ou the fragment in De Re Publica, IV.
viii: sic pont‘ficio jure sanctitudo sepulturae (p. 429 of his
edition).

Mei haereret. After coluissent and sanfissent, we should
expect the pluperfect Ιιοωίοοεις hut, as Ktihner remarks, the
imperfectis here used to refer the idea to that very time iu
which the ancient Romans attached such sancdty to funeral
rites. He cites a similar case from Laelius, iv. 13 (supra,
p on: quod non fecissent....si....arditrarentur. Infra,
