but punctuates as follows: Lirim s. dedu, (C. 0., C.s., Μ.
T.,cnnrnlibua,a. ce. Ennium: qui s. m. n. q. Plantae) et
Naevian thus making tbe grammatical construction of Nae-
vius the sameas thatnf livius. Isee no sufficient reason,
however, for chenging the reading given by the MSS. The
separation of qui from its antecedent Livius is not without
precedente in other passages io Cicero (Billerbeek cites

dsN. D. l. xxiii. dh); nor, granting it to be en inaccuracy
in style, ia it at all incredihle thet Cicero should hare

been guilty of some inadvertency in composition. The per- l

erthetiml nature of the clause 0. Claudio, C.s.‚ Μ. Τ. c. a. l

arr. Ennium, the whole of which is introduoed simply to l

mark the time when Liriua exhibited his first play, makes the
irregular position nf qui, es it appears to me, every natural

Cicero, in this place, to the comparative eges of Livius, Ne·
rina, aod Plautus. The three were nearly contemporaries,
Lirim exhibiting hie first play when Plautus was ebout four·
teon years old, and at leaat live years before the first drama of Ἰ
Nerius was enacted. There appears to have been in Cice·

thought it necessary, then, to mention the feet thet Livius

was older than these two dramatista, in order to make clear ¹
the point sn aasential to bie argument, that Livius was the ,

first Roman who could properly be called a poet.
