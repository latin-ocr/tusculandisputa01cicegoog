TUSCULAN DISPUTATIONS.
BOOK FIRsr.

Tun Tusculan Disputations os Cicero consist of five books:
the first, De contemnenda morte· the second, De tolerando
dolore; the third, De aegritudine lenienda; the fourth, De
reliquis animi perturbationibas; and the fifth supporting the
thesis, lirratem ad beate uiuendum se ipsa esse contentam.
The work is a series of discussions upon these subjects,
represented as having been held, on five successive days,
in the Tusculan villa os Cicero, soon after M. lunius Bru-
tus-to whom it is oddressed-hed departed for the gov-
ernment of Gallia (s. c. 46). It was given to the world early
in n. c. 44, Α. a. a. 709, the sixty-third year of Cicero's age.

L l. Defensionam laboribus. Although Cicero in several
instanccs performed, with distinguished success, the part os an
accuser, in by sartho greater part of his orations he appeared
in the more popular character of a desendet of the accused;
and it is iu this character that he prefers to allude to himself.
Kiihner cites De Offic. ΙΙ. xia 49: (Iudicioram) ratio du·
plen est. Nam ea accusatione et defensione constat: quaram
etri laudabilior est defensio tamen accuuio probata
persaepe est. Cf. Quintil. Inst. Orat. XII viil.
