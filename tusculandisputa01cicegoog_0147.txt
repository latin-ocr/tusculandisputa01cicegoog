Ul possit judicari: So thul it coa bejodged. ‘⁸ It may be
observed of the particle ot (uti), that it has its root in the
same interrogative and relative pronominal theme from which

uter, oti, dte, are derived, and therefore originally signifies
horo, or (relatively) cs. From how is deduued the significa·
tion that, as applied to express a purpose and the object os
the verb, and from the relative usage partly tho signification
na soon as (at ocni, abiit), partly that of ao thot (just as the
pronoun pai acquires the signification os so thot he). Then
the original signification is still further lost, so that the word
only marks out a proposition indefinitcly and generally as the
object or complement ol another (with verbs ol happeuiug).”
Μ. §sva a, obs.

Age jum. Hand, in his Tursellioas, Vol. 1. p. 209, re-
marks that nge jam is osten used when the speaker concedes
some point, and at the same time, being about to bring up
some other difficulty or objection‚ calls attention to the argu-
ments he is going to use.

Vlll. 15. Ecqui. So Kurra, Tregd, Tisch.‚ aster the
MS. Regius and several others. Most editors read Ecquid ,⁸
but, as Kiihuer says, the rare word ecqui would be very lia·
ble to be corrupted by the copyists. Ecqui =ecquo modo.

Quantam mali. ...dejecerim How much coil you hooc re-
moved. Kiihner notices the same use of dejicere lilre detra·
here in Tuae. Il. v. 14: pacatior de doloris terrore dejeceris.
lv. xxxvii. 80: adiuratione o ae esse dejecto.

Mori. Bentley conjectures mora, which Kiihner adopts.
But this use of nort can be justified by the rendering which
Tischer gives to eliam mortario, -“ auch in Bezug auf un-
sern Zustand nach dem Tude,” “ even in relation to our
condition after death.’'

Calceos: the good, limit os the rece-course. “Ex eo au·
tem coir curriculi linis [in circo] vocatus est, quud creti aut
etiam cclcc notaretur.'’ Cf. Lucretius, Vl. 91. Seneca,
Epist. 108: hooc ptam nanc ia circo cretam vocamus, anti·
quicolcern dicebant.
