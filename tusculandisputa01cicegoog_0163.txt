Phidias. The magnificent colossalstatue of Athena in the
Parthenon, made of ivory and gold, was the greatest of the
works ol Phidias at Atheus, and second only to his statuens
Zetm at Olympia. (For a description ol this noble work ol
art, see Smith's Dict. of Biog. aad Myra. ΙΙΙ. ρ. 250. 8.) The
shield was ornarnented oo both sides with embossed work,
representing, on the inner side, the battle of the giants with
the gods, audon the outer, the battle of the Amemus with
the Athenians. Among these figures he introduced his own
likeness, in such away that it could not be removed without
destroying the whole ahield (Aristotle, De hiando, vi).

Sui similam. The tole as commonly stated, that siculis
takes the genitive when it denotas an immol resemblance,
or one os character or quality, and the dative when it denotas
au eatamml resemblance, or one ol figure or appearance, will
not hold without exceptione. ln Cicero aad the older writers,
whichever kind os resemblance it denote, it almost always

takes a genitive os the names· of living beings (especially
gode and men), and is found with the genitive and dative
promiscnously os other nouas. (See M. lm, Obs. 2, §242
b, Obs. 2.) Infra, xxxiii. 81: socie vel patrie, nita amulum
