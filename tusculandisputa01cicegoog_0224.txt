good illustration ol' thia rule: quandoque... defecerit, tum
...- t.
Igllddo Derived‚ like ita, from the pronomina! rooti

(wlrenoe are ir and lic), and the demonstrative suffix aar (r).
‘¹ Itur‚’' says Hand, “is kindred to ita, whether hy the oom-
tnutation of the letters r and a, so aa to be the same as itus,
or by the addition ol' r final, aa in other adverbsz for example,
aa luculente becomes renitenter. The prefixed igis achanged
form ol the syllable ic (as vigesimus was written instead of
vicesimus, negligo for melego), and thiais, in accordanoe
with the ancient usage in writing and speaking, is bia”
Igitur takes the first plaee in a sentence when it modifiee
the whole clause, and not merely some particular notimt in it.

With the elevated sentimenta Cicero ascribes to Africanus
in the sixth and seventh chapters‚ we may compare tha linea

Nor in the glietering soil
Sat off to the world, norin broad rumor lieet
But lives and spread· alati hy those pure eyes,
And perfect witness ofell-judging Jove3

As he pronouncea lastly on eaoh deod,
Of eo much fame in heaven expect thy meed.”
