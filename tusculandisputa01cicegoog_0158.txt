referred to vitoe ae its antecedent. Ktihner explains the
passage thus: Vita e virtutis praeceptis acta dicitur esse dux ’

in caelum vita hominum vitiis ac voluptatibus deditorum
dicitur humi retineri et permanere tamen, b. e. vita ejusmodi
hominurn etiam post mortem in his terris continuatur, -quia
eorum animi, terrestria amplexati, in caelum evolare uon pos·
suut, sed circum terram volutantur, —ita tamen, ut ea nou
altera morte exstinguatur, sed permaneat.

It cannot be denied that the construction with our reading
is harah. Some old editors read retinent,- some MSS. reti·
neret et permanerent lumen. Lambinus, in bis ed. of 1566,
in ceteris eoa humi retineret, ut peremnerent tamen. One MS.
gives el retinerentur et permanerent. F. A. Wolf conjectures,
gnum celeri berni retinerentur, ut permanerent tamen· Krih-
ner suggests, queue, ut claris o. ets. d. ι’. c. s. esee, ita ceteros
hami retineret, ut perntnnerent tamen. Whatever be the cor·
rect reading, however, the idea ie evident. It was a common =
belief among the Greeks and Romans, that the souls of those ¹
who, in this lise, enslave themselves to sensuality, unable
to rise, alter death, to the ebodea ol‘ pure spirits, linger
arouud their old bodies, or become joined to new and interior
oues. Cs. Plato, Phaedo, 69, 70, 131 ; Servius ou the AEneid,
vl. 1273 and Macrobius ou Scipio’s Dream, Lib. I. c 9.
Souls os this character, says Plato (Phaedo, 69, 70, Cary's
trans), “ impressed with that which is corporeal, which the
intercourse and communion os the body, through constant as
eooiation aud grdat attention, have made natural to them,
by possessing which [thoy] are weighed down, and drawn
again into the visible world through dread of the invisible
andos Hades,—wander, it is said, amongst monuments and
tombe; about which, indeed, certain shadowy phantoms ol
eouls hare been seen, being such images as those souls pro·
duced which have not departed pure from the body, but which
partake ol the visihle, on which account, also, they are visi·
