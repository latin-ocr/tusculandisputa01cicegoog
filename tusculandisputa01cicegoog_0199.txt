Si quid occidisset. “ By euphemism for si sorte moriturus
esset. For the ancients, influenced by a refined aud elegant
feeling, abstained as much as possible from words of ill omen,
and were accustomed to express an unpleesant or moumful
thing by a word of milder signification. Hence, dreading
the word mori, in place of it they said cita metm, decedere,
or simply decedere, uita sangi, depunge, end the lile. The
expressions, si quid miti occiderit, or si quid hamoni milti
evenerit, si quid mihi humorum contigerit, or si quid milri “
humanitus occiderit, correspond to the Greek ἤν τι πάθω.”
