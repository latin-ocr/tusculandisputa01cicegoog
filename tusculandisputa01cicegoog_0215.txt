cuae. 1. 189

Terence, one from Varro, and several from Cicero: in some
cases equidem is found io this construction in MSS, but edi·
tors have changed the reading. Hand's arguments, however,
have not receivedthe full assent of all scholare. Ritsohl, in
his critical edition of the Trinummus of Plautus, published at
Bono in 1848, in which he gives the most elaborate recension
of the text as yet made, announces his intention to adopt qui-

dem for equidem in every passage in Plautus where it is not
referred to the first person ; and, atter an examination of all
the examples from this author adduced by Hand, rejects his
reading in each instance, adding “ non recurret opinor furca
expulsum equidem.” (Prolegomeum pp. 76-79.) Adhuc
sub judice lio ert,· but Hand’s opinion seems most satisfac·

is among his followers; and Kritz, who, on Sallust, Cot. 51,
bad defended the derivation from ego and quidem, retracta
this opinion in his note on lug„ p. 53, and gives his assent,
also, to the view of Hand.

The peculiar reference of this adverb in signification to the
first person, must be acknowledged, whatever derivatico we
adopt. “ Anciont usage‚'' says Hand, “employed the de·
monstrative force of the prefixed e chiefly in such a manner,
that by it the speaker should mark with a certain affirmative
force those things which he avowed concerning himself and
his own opinion, or in regard to his own affairs Hence it
happened that equidem was joined, as a general rule, with the Χ
first person of the verb. The Latios, then, had an appro-
priate word by which the speaker might turn the attention
of his hearers to his own affair or his own opinion, and add
weight to his declaration in regard to himself.'’ This expla-
nation accounts also for the peculiar force os equidem when
used with the second or third person, which Kritz considered
as equivalent to that of the phrase meo quidem sententio.

With the same peculiar reference to the mind of the speak-
er must we understand the intensive demonstrative force of
the syllable ein the various other compounds mentioned by
