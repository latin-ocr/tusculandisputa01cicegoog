INTRODUOTION· XV

be an eterual sleep, aad its only advantage the release from
the toils aud somows of this life. But the very manner in
which the contrary suppositionis for a moment adopted in
tha De Senectute, only increases the appearance os sincerity
with which the doctrine of immortalityia defended iu that
dialogue. “ If,’' says Cato, “ aa certain paltry philosophare
suppose-quidam annue philosophi-I shall feel nothing
when I audead, I have uc sear that these philosophare will
laugh at my delusion when they aud Ι shall be no more.''
And iu neither os these dialogues cau the supposition, for the
sake of the argument, that the contraryis true, be taken aa
an indication of doubt in Cicero's mind, any more than tha
words os many Christian writers, who, after vindicating the
claims of their saith to universal acceptauoe, have added,
“ Even if this religion be all a sable and au impositiou, uo
harm, but rather incalculable beueht, would result from its
adoption.’' The confidenoe with whicha belief in a future
lise is asserted in these two treatises, “ designed to be gener·
ally intelligible rather thau philosophically accurate,” and thus
leaving their writer comparatively uoshackled by bis sceptical
system, should be allowed great weight, as Rittcr suggesta,
iu prout* os the reality of his conviction; while his seeming
to leave the question undecided in the Tusculau Disputations
can be easily explained by the restrictione os his philosophy,
in the same manner as he himself accounts sor the sacr that
Socrates-who, as Ritter, Grote, aud authorities generally
agree, undoubtedly believed iu the existence os the aoul aster
death -pretended, in his Apology, to consider the point as
undetermined, “etsi, quod praeter deoa negat scire quem·
quam, id scit ipse ..... nam dixit aute; aed suum illud, nihil
at affirmet, tenet ad autrennam.” ibae. Diap. Ι. xlii. 99.

But perhaps the most serious difficulty is presented in sever-
al expressions in Cicero’s letters to his friends, which seem to
imply a doubt ot' the existence of a future state. Here, again,
we should inquire, What was Cicero’s purpose iu writiug
these lettersl lu some of them it was, doubtlesa, to admin-
