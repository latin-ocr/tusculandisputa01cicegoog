De Consolatione, preserved by Lactantius: “ Nec enim omni-

lum patere. Nam vitiis et sceleribus contaminatos deprimi
in tenebras atquo in coeno jacere docuerunt3 castos autem

The same spiritns literary scepticism which gave risa to
the great controversy in the last half-century nn the author·
ship os the poems of Homer, has attached the genuineness oi
the Somnium Scipionis. Kuhnhardt‚ a German scholar,
publinhed some articles in 1820, in which he maintained that
this Dream is not the composition of Cicero, citherae a

whole or in any considerable part, but was written by some <
rhetorician of no great talent. The arguments os this heretic,
however, have been ably and triumphantly refuted by Moser
in his edition of the De Re Palline, pp. 510, 511.
