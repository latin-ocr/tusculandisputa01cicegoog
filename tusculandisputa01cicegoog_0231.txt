CICERO ΟΝ FRIENDSHIP.

-—.-—

Tun dialogus called laelius, sive De Amicitia, was written
a. c. 14, after the Ceto Major, and, like that treatise, was
very appropriately dedicated to Atticus, ‘¹ the only individua}
among his contemporaries to whom Cicero gave his whole
heart”

“The imaginary conversation is supposed to have taken
place between C. Laelius Sapiens and his two sons-in-law,
C. Fannius and Q. Mucius Seoevola, a few days after the

· death os‘Asrioauus (a. c. 129), and to have been repeated, in

aster times, by Seoevola to Cicero. Laelius begins by a pane·
gyrio ou his friend. Theo, at the nequest os the young
men„he explains his own sentiments with regard to the
origin, nature, limite, and velue of friendship; traces its con·
neotiou with the higher moral virtues, and lays down the
rules whioh ought to be observed iu order to render it
permanent and mutually advantageous.'’ Smith’s Dect,
Vol. Ι. p. 733.
In the extraot here given, Lalius is the speaker.
