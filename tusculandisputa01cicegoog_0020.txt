lu regard to the secuml point, in none ut' the treatisesiu
which Cicero alludes ιο the immortality of the soul, unless we
except the Somnium Scipionis, was it his immediate object to
asscrt the truth of that doctrine. ln that beautiful Vision this
truth is maintained with a directness that admits of no ques·

be given, - that the admission of this truth was not essential
to the defencc of the proposition to be established. Cato
could still maintain that the sear of dissolution ought not to
erubitter our declining years, and Laelius that it had gone
well with his departed friend, even is death were granted to
