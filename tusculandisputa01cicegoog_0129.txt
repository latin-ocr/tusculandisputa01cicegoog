Qnoe . . . . pertinerent. ‘⁶ The subjunctive is used in all sub·
ordinate propositione (whether relative or connected by con·
junctione), which are added to complete nn idea expressed by
su infinitivo, or by a proposition standing in the subjunctive,
or by an accusative with an infinitivo, the contente of which
subordinate proposition are asserted by the speaker not simply
as an actual fact, but only asa constituent part of the idea
stated in the infinitivo or subjunctive.'’ M. j 369.

Quum. . . . contineretur. The subjunctive with quum cott-
soe. A. de S. §263.5.-B.§1oe.-Z. §572 Notiee, fur·
ther, both in pertinerent and in contineretur, Cieero's use os the
subjunctive, ιο denote, as Moser says, “quid ipse cogitaverit,
quum hoe consilium caperet.” We heve also here an inter·
esting example of the use os the imperfect in a general propo-
sition expressing what is true in all times, where in English
we should use the present. By thus making the tenses oi
these two verbs dependent upon that cf putavi, Cicero repre·
sents the idea contained in the clause quum . . . ‚contineretur es
one which occuned to bis mind ot tlte time in otton be resoleed
ιο write upon philosophical subjecte ; so that the clause penne
... . contineretur has this force : Since, as it then occurred ιο
my mind, -as Ι was then thinking, — etc. The seme prin-
ciples apply to posset below: non quio . . . . posset: not because
1 tborcgltt philosophy cannot, etc. Our English imperfect po-
tentiol is adequate to express this idea without any periphrase:
translate the passage, not tltot philosophy might not be learned,
etc. In the clause quoe philosophie dicitur, the indicative is
used because these words are introduced simply ns an expla-
nation, end may be omitted without prejudice to the leading
idea. For tbe gendes of the relative, see apere B. je.
n. 23 A. dt S. §206 (10).

Quae queem digno nonnemo.- rtoee ar teor orreo eloy '

nod deemeot wortlty, etc. The subjunctive ina relative prop-
osition, to limit something that is stated in general terms to
a certain defined class. See M. §364 Obs. 2.
