the most serious difficulties of syntax and interpretation,
without the injustice to the student of robbing him
entirely of the pleasure and advantage os surmounting
obstacles by his own unaided effora Particular atten-
tion has been given to the illustration os the subjunctive
mood3 and it is believed that thereis not in the book
an instance of its use where the principles upon which
it depende have not been set forth, in words or by reler-
ences, in some part of the notes. Every teacherwill
acknowledge the propriety of devoting especial labor to
the elucidation of a form that conveys so many delicate
ahades of meaning, and upon which so much os the
beauty and expressiveness of the Latin language de·
pends. On this point, as on many others, great assist-
ance has been derived from the Latin Grammar of
Madvig, whose translator, Mr. Woods, (Onford, 1849,)
has rendered a service to English scholarship by mak-
ing an admirable treatise aocessible, which bears the
markS, on every page, of the discemment and cleamess
of a master mind. From this work large quotations are
made in the notes. The derivation and soree of the
