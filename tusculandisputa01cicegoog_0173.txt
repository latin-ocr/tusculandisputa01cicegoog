however, this attractiva is very rare, and is found after an ac·
tiva verb only where the writer at first contemplated another
tum of the discourse, and afterwards added the subordinate
proposition: Simul aerem Pamphilam, ne orata nostm nepae-
at diutinas celare (Ter. fler. IV. i. 60= ne Pmampt' M.
