Lirim (Andronicus). The earliest Roman poet, as far as
poetical literature is concerned.

Ennius. The father of Roman epic poetry, and distin·
guished also as a dramatist; bom 2³9 a. c.

Plautus. The most celebrated comio poet of Rome, born
about 254 a. c., died tet.

Naeuius. A Roman epic and dramatic poet, born probably
between 274 and 264 a. c.

Qui fait major nota qaam Plautus et Naeuius. This pas·
sage has given commentators no little difficulty. The posi-
tion of qai would seem to make it necessary that it should be
referred to Ennius as its antecedent, but the fact is, that
Ennius was not older than Plautus and Naevius, but younger
than either. If, then, we retain the reading qai fuit . . ..
Naeuius, wemust either suppose, with Daris, that Cicero has
made here a σφάλμα μνημονικόν, or we must, like Orelli,
Klotz, and Moser, refer the relative to Liuius as its antecedent.
The explanation given by Davis-that Cicero in this pas·
sege made a mistalte in regard to his sacts- is rightly re·
jected by most scholars as altogether improbable, particularly
since, in his Brutus, xviii„ he points out aud censeres the
same mistake in the annalist Accius which is here charged
upon himself. The other alternative, -to refer the qai to
133333,- is rejected by Kiihner, because, in the first place,
he says, such is the nature of the relative pronoen that it
ought to be referred to the noun next preceding, and, in the
second place, an addition such as is contained in the clause
qaisoit. . . haeae is feeble and inappropriate, especially in
this place, where there is no discussion about the ratio tern-
poram, but 3 mere passing allusion is made to the age of
Livius. He thinks, therefore, that the passage was first writ-
ten 33 the margin of a MS. by some commentator, to defiue
more precisely the age cf Livius, and that it afterwards crept
into the text3 and he incloses these words in bra'cltets in his
edition. Some other eminent editors take the same view of
the subject, 3ηά accordingly Wolf omits altogether the words
