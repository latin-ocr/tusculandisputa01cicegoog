It is hardly worth while to refuta the well-known ancient
opinion, defended by Henry Stephanus, that ito is the Greek
εἶτα; for these words are connected neither in origin nor iu
signification. But the relation between is and ito is the same
as that which appears between οὗτος and οὕτως.” Hand's
(lbrsellinur, ΙΙΙ. p. 466. This particle is here used in a
clause giving the reason of the preceding statement, and with
asignilication similar to that os adeo. See Haud's Tarsel.

Deinde: them next; thereupon3 (εἶτα). This adverb is
used in speaking “ of things successive and next in lapse of
time, and is almost the same as posteo, tum. Itis not neces·

omission of the copula, ultro citro. The inverted order citro
ultroque' rs never found. This formula does not denote oppo-
site directions of something m the middle, but different places
and distinct parts, so that it is the same as hoc illuc and ab
utroque parte. lt ts both used of motion, and of things which
are done by each party or with reference to each party. The
, Greeks say δεῦρο κάκεῖ, κάκεῐσι καὶ τὸ δεῦρο, the Fieneh pur

equipoised aud unite as it were in one idea, there is no need
of a copula; but when regard is to be had to each side sepa·
rately, and a thing is said to be done iu turns or mutually, not
by one party alone, but also by tha other, the copula is always
