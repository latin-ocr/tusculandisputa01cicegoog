vn. Immo: On tlte contrary. 'I’his word, allied with the
superlative imos, mesos literally ort thr under ride, ort tlte
other tide, on the reverse,-econtrorio. Ithence sc·
quires its meaning, in unswers conveying eromenion, of “ no,
on the other hand,'' “no iodecd‚’' “much rather.” Some
grammariaus have considered it as sometimes an offirmotiue
particle, to be translated by “ yes indeed‚’' ‘⁸ by all means '’;
but iu all the passages where such a meaning has been as·
signed it, its primsry corrective force can be easily distin·
guichad. The answer may courcy an assent to the propo-
sition of the preceding speaker, but immo always, in such
cases introduces some stronger expression, and thus, even
than, dmiee tha wealrer expression which precedes. “ This
increase,’'·says Zumpt (Gr. §277)‚ “may be sometimes ex·
pressed in English by ‘noy,' or‘noy etot) But this does
not justiiy the assertion that immo is sn affirmative adverh.”
In consequence os the derivatico ot this word, some gramma·
rinos prefer tha orthography imo, which is adopted by Moser.
But the adjectiva itsell was sometimes written immos; and
the weight os authority is decidedly in favor os imum.
