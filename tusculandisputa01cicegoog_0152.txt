Μή. The reading l give was suggested by Bentley, and
has been adopted by Davis, Tregder, and Tischer. The
change of declarant into declarat obvietes all difficulties of
construction and interpretation, and is justified by the fact to
which Tischer alludes, that in the Regius MS. the singular
aad plural are osten confounded. Moser gives the same
reading, but brackets the whole sentence Dederat... ‚aen-
lentr'u, as the gloss of some skilsul hand. Several editors
inclose the words between nornen and ipse nrtlem enimenin
brackets ; others mark in the same manner the werde et ani-
mosos et h. e. et aa u. enitentia. Orelli’s remark un this point,
however, is based on a round principle os textual criticism :
“Praestat tamen in illis et cointae, cet„ λογικὸν ἁμάρτημα Ci-
ceronis ipsius agnoscere, quarn glossema.” Moser himself suc·
ecsst'ully vindicates the Ciceronian purity os the words which
he brackets. The sentiment os the whole passage, as Kiihner

remarks, is this: There have been philosophers who said that =
the mind was nothing hut air; and this opinion seems ιο he ²

confirmed by the Latin language‚ which has many words aad
phrases in which the word areima has the same signification
asnnimue.

lpse cutem artimus. Some editors, thinking that the werd
between omnen and r'pre should be omitted, read ipre enirn
unimus, - a reading which is not supported by the MSS.

Zenoni. Zeno, the founder os the Stoic philosophy. .

Zenoni....anr‘muer'gniaoidetur. “lgnr'e intelligitur πνεῦ-
μα ἔνθερμον. Diog. L. vii. 157.” Kiihner. Zeno regarded
individual souls as being what the soul of the universe was;
as of the nature of lire, or as worm breuth; and therefore
as perishable. Smith’a nin. cs Biog. und Mythol. Fire
was very naturally regarded hy the ancients as the symbol os
all immaterial forces.

singuli: scil. dicum The idea is: The opinions I have thus
far stated concerning the nature of the mind have been com·

monly accepted; those Ι am now about to state have been
advanced almost by single individuale.
