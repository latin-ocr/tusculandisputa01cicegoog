chiefly from Smith's Dictionaries, and various editions
of the Tusculan Disputations. Frequent reference hes

on Latin Syntax by Dr. Beck,-and to the Grammar

of Andrews and Stoddard3 and the recent publication
of an excellent American translation hes authorized
occasional references to the Lexicon of Freund.

The high character of many of the editions of Greek
and Roman authors which have lately appeared from
the American presa, indicates the repid progress of
classical scholarship in this country in the last few
yearS. The light recent philological investigatione have
shed upon the history, structure, end significance of the
ancient languageS, and thus upon the science of lan-
guage itself‚-—lenguage, which is at once the great
instrument of thought and the noblest productos mind,
-adds a new dignity and value to even the most ele·
mentary processes in classical instruction. We must
ever be indebted to the Old World for the thoroughness
and ahility with which her philologists have pursued
these investigations3 hut American scholare can share
in the fruita of their labore, weigh and combine their
decisione with an independent judgment, and perform
auseful, though comparatively humhle service, in ap·
plying them to increase the value and efficiency of
classical studies asa means of mental training. The
editor will he gratified if this book shall help, even in
the slightest degree, in thus advancing the interests of
sound learning.
